- **[Ecommerce Microservices](https://github.com/Ferza17/ecommerce-microservices-v2)**

  I specialize in developing scalable and resilient backend systems using **Golang** and **NestJS**, with a focus on implementing modern architectures like **GraphQL API Gateways**, **CQRS**, **SAGA**, and **Event Sourcing**. My expertise extends to **gRPC** for efficient service communication, **message queuing** for asynchronous processing, and tools like **distributed tracing** and **circuit breakers** to ensure system reliability and observability. Additionally, I build secure **payment services** and maintain high code quality through **unit testing and mocking** using Mockery.

- **[Gokomodo.com](https://gokomodo.com/)**

  When I was a Backend Engineer at Gokomodo.com, I primarily used Golang to build scalable and robust microservices. My role involved performing code reviews to ensure high code quality and maintainability, as well as contributing as a core team member in the integration of ERP systems, specifically Odoo.

- **[Spring-boot Ecommerce Microservices](https://github.com/Ferza17/spring-microservices)**

  The development of microservices using **Spring Boot** with the **Saga pattern** aims to resolve challenges related to **data consistency** in distributed systems. As microservices are inherently decentralized, traditional monolithic transactions (managed through a single database) cannot be used effectively. The Saga pattern is a design strategy that ensures **eventual consistency** by orchestrating a series of transactions that span across multiple microservices.
